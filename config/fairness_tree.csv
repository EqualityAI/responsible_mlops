2,Y,,,12,Yes/No,"Do you care more that two similar individuals are treated the same, or that overall the groups will be treated the same?",Using individual fairness may be appropriate when assessing a model that decides who qualifies for a certain life-insurance policy. Similar people with similar medical conditions should receive the same insurance. ,

11,Y,,4,22,Yes/No,Will your model be trained on an outcome with a reliable label or ground truth? ,"Ground truth is available in hospital readmission due to the ability to follow-up and verify a patient has been readmitted. By contrast, using total costs spent as a proxy for high risk is subjective and does not represent the ground truth.",

12,Y,,2,18,Yes/No,Do you have a way to measure similarity between individuals ? ,"An example of not having a metric would be if a company is hiring 2 out of 3 applicants and the company did not carefully define a way to rank applicants.  If you can assign a score to each individual based on their attributes, you can calculate the distance between them",

21,Y,,11,29,Yes/No,Do you have features/explanatory variables in your data that provide information about the outcome variable while at the same time are correlated with the sensitive variable in a legitimate way?,"E.g., a person's height may be an effective predictor for whether they can receive a heart from a particular donor but also can be highly correlated with gender resulting in disparity across genders if you don't account for height.",

22,Both,,11,36,Recall/Precision/Both,Would you rather your model catch positives at a high rate equally between sensitive groups (recall) or is it more important for your sensitive groups to feel equally confident in a positive prediction (precision)?

23,Fixed,,22,26,Floating/Fixed,"If your model returns a probability for the positive outcome, will there be floating thresholds selected and fine-tuned by practitioners which accommodate a changing context or will a fixed/single threshold be chosen that is valid for different use cases? ","A potential floating threshold could be if a provider makes the decision based on risk or turns the decision over to the patient, e.g., there is a 10% chance that a certain treatment regime will prolong life. A patient or provider may have different thresholds for risk they're willing to take. ",
