# Slack Guidelines:

## Read and understand our [Equality AI Manifesto](https://github.com/EqualityAI/responsible_mlops/blob/main/MANIFESTO.md). 
Our Manifesto provides insight into how we operate as an organization, our responsibilities, and our commitments to AI for Good, AI that is Fair, and AI for Equity.

## Be Nice. Be Respectful.
We cannot stress enough that we want this to be a safe, comfortable and inclusive environment. Please read our [code of conduct](https://github.com/EqualityAI/responsible_mlops/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) if you need more information on this guideline.

## Keep timezones in mind and be respectful of peoples’ time.
People on Slack are distributed and might be in a very different time zone from you, so don't use @channel @here (this is reserved for admins anyways). 
If you post in off hours, please be patient, someone will get back to you once they get back to work.

## Asking for help and reporting bugs

- Checkout [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/EqualityAI/discussions) - this is where we want most of our collaborative problem solving, discussion, updates, etc to go because it helps keep a more visible record for EAI users. This is the preferred method to discuss feature requests and enhancement requests.
- GitHub [issues](https://github.com/EqualityAI/responsible_mlops/issues) are used to report a known problem/bug that doesn't require discussion, or task that needs to be completed. Please add a new entry to the [issues](https://github.com/EqualityAI/responsible_mlops/issues) section when required. 

## Asking your question in Slack

**Slack support channels:**
<ul>
	<li>#support: Having trouble with running your EAI code, an integration or anything else, beyond just getting started? Post here.</li>
	<li>#feature-requests: Have a good idea for an EAI feature or a new use case? Post it here. </li>
	</ul>
  
## Use Public Channels, Not Private Groups
Slack is about communication, so use public channels whenever possible. This is good for transparency, but also keeps the community vibrant and alive. You also have an opportunity to help someone else who might find your conversation helpful or encouraging.

## Promoting Products or Services
Equality AI understands that the data science field is ripe with new technologies and collaboration opportunities, so we would love to hear about your relevant tools and services! 

1. You're allowed to;
    1. Promote your tool when you introduce yourself in #introductions.
    2. Promote your tool in the #introdutions channel once. 
    3. Mention your tool if someone mentions or is organic to a solution.
2. If you see a partnership opportunity with Equality AI please DM @Andy LaHart. We would love to create collaborative content and work with you if possible in promoting your product/service.
